    <content type="text"><![CDATA[你的儿女，其实并不是你的儿女他们的诞生源自于你的情欲以及自身对于生命的渴望 他们借助你来到这个世界，却非为了你而来他们在你身旁，然而并不是你的私人物品 你可以给予他们的是你的爱，不是你的想法你可以庇护的是他们的身体，不是他们的灵魂 因为他们的灵魂属于明天属于你做梦也无法到达的明天 你可以拼尽全力，变得像他们一样你不能绞尽脑汁，让他们变得和你一样 因为生命不会后退，时间也不在过去停留你是弓，儿女是箭 弓箭手望着未来之路上的箭靶他用尽力气将你拉开，使他的箭射得又快又远 所以怀着快乐的心情，在弓箭手的手中弯曲吧因为他爱一路飞翔的箭，也爱无比稳定的弓 Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite,and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.]]></content>
